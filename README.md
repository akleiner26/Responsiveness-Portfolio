## About

One of the most important aspects of modern day web development is universal access. Contemporary web users have access to the internet in almost every imaginable location in the developed world. But with accessibility comes a wide range of devices that coding must format to. It is the web developers job to ensure that a design aesthetic, and elements within said aesthetic, are consistent across all accessing platforms. This ranges from cell phones, to smart televisions.

This web designed aimed to not only create a working portfolio for myself, but to delve into the working grid model that bootstrap has made open source code. By utlizing bootstraps grid, I was able to design a page that not only aligns properly for desirable aesthetics, but also adapts to meet the needs of cross-platform users. In addition, custom CSS was used to adjust any small anomlies that might have arisen.

As seen in this project, bootstraps open source code material is one of many ways in which a modern developer can accomodate users of a wide range of devices. Since every device has a different aspect ratio and resolution, it is important for coders to utilize tools such as this in order to create a consistent brand image.
